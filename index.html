      <h2>Why I Love Working Out</h2>
      <p>Working out helps me stay healthy, get stronger, and keep my energy up for baseball and school.</p>
      <p>Consistency is key — even on busy days, I try to move my body and stay active.</p>
      <p class="assignment">Now it’s time to bring that website to life with style. You’ll work with both traditional CSS rules and Flexbox-based layout techniques to improve your site’s appearance and readability.

      This assignment mirrors a critical step in your final project workflow. Just like in your final project, you’ll:

      <ul>
        <li>Write custom CSS in a separate stylesheet</li>
        <li>Use classes and IDs to style specific content</li>
        <li>Apply Flexbox to create structure and spacing</li>
        <li>Maintain clean folder structure and commit history</li>
      </ul>

      By the end of this assignment, you'll have a beautiful, readable, and functional website.</p>
